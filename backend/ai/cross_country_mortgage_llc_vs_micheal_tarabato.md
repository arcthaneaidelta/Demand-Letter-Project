# Formal Demand Regarding Employment Termination and Associated Violations

I. Introduction and Purpose Statement

I, Michael Tarabato, am writing to formally address the serious grievances I have encountered during my employment with Cross Country Mortgage LLC as an appraiser, commencing in January 2016, at our California location. This letter serves as a formal demand for remedies concerning my immediate termination without cause on March 25, 2023, and associated violations of employment law, which I believe were unlawful and unjust.

The purpose of this correspondence is to bring to your attention the critical infractions involving wrongful termination and unsafe working conditions as delineated under California Labor Code and OSHA regulations. Specifically, Cal. Lab. Code § 6311 protects employees from retaliation for refusing unsafe work conditions, mandating employers to ensure workplace safety. Furthermore, the unauthorized deductions from my wages, in violation of Cal. Lab. Code § 224, require immediate rectification.

Additionally, the principles established in wrongful termination jurisprudence, notably Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal.3d 167 (Cal. 1980), limit an employer's discretion in terminating an employee at will, particularly when it contravenes established public policy. This letter emphasizes the gravity of these violations and seeks to resolve this matter amicably.

I urge you to consider the seriousness of the issues presented herein and the legal obligations incumbent upon Cross Country Mortgage LLC. I look forward to your prompt response to avoid further escalation of this matter.

Sincerely,

Michael Tarabato

# Factual Background

Michael Tarabato, the aggrieved party, commenced his employment with Cross Country Mortgage LLC ("Cross Country") in January 2016, serving as an appraiser at the company's California location. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Tarabato dutifully fulfilled his responsibilities, adhering to the company's standards and expectations. However, his employment was marred by a series of unjust and unlawful actions perpetrated by the employer, culminating in his abrupt and baseless termination on March 25, 2023.

During his employment, Mr. Tarabato was subjected to unsafe working conditions, contrary to the protections afforded under California Labor Code § 6311, which safeguards employees from being discharged for refusing to work under conditions violating safety regulations (Cal. Lab. Code § 6311 (West 2024)). Despite raising concerns regarding these hazardous conditions, Cross Country failed to take corrective actions, thereby endangering the health and safety of its employees in violation of OSHA standards, which mandate the provision of a safe working environment.

In addition to the unsafe conditions, Mr. Tarabato experienced unauthorized payment cutoffs, in direct contravention of California Labor Code § 224. This statute prohibits employers from making unauthorized deductions from wages, ensuring that employees receive their full, lawful compensation (Cal. Lab. Code § 224 (West 2024)). These financial discrepancies were neither consented to by Mr. Tarabato nor legally justified, resulting in unwarranted financial distress.

The culmination of these grievances was Mr. Tarabato's immediate termination on March 25, without cause or warning. Such termination not only disregards the procedural fairness owed to employees but also contravenes the tenets of California's wrongful termination laws. These laws protect employees from retaliatory discharge, particularly when the termination is a response to the employee's legitimate reporting of unsafe conditions or other protected activities.

Despite Mr. Tarabato's efforts to address these issues with Cross Country, including prior complaints which were systematically ignored, the employer persisted in maintaining an unlawful and hostile work environment. This disregard for employee rights and safety is not only a breach of statutory obligations but also a profound failure of corporate responsibility.

# Legal Violations

In addressing the claims made by Michael Tarabato against Cross Country Mortgage LLC, several legal violations are evident under both California state law and federal regulations. This section identifies and explains the specific statutes and regulations that Cross Country Mortgage LLC is alleged to have violated, highlighting the seriousness of the infractions and the legal protections afforded to Mr. Tarabato.

1. **California Labor Code Section 6311: Unsafe Working Conditions**

   Michael Tarabato, in his capacity as an appraiser for Cross Country Mortgage LLC, was subjected to unsafe working conditions, which he reasonably and in good faith believed to be hazardous. Under California Labor Code Section 6311, it is unlawful for an employer to lay off or discharge an employee who refuses to perform work in such unsafe conditions. The statute protects employees who act to safeguard their well-being in the workplace. Cross Country Mortgage LLC's actions, as described, suggest a violation of these protections, undermining the statutory intent to ensure worker safety.

2. **OSHA Provisions for Workplace Safety**

   The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) mandates that employers provide a workplace free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees. By failing to adhere to these safety standards, Cross Country Mortgage LLC compromised the health and safety of Mr. Tarabato and potentially other employees. The failure to provide a safe working environment constitutes a breach of the General Duty Clause under OSHA.

   - **Source**: OSHA - [Law and Regulations](http://www.osha.gov/laws-regs)

3. **California Labor Code Section 224: Unauthorized Payment Cutoffs**

   It is alleged that Cross Country Mortgage LLC engaged in unauthorized payment cutoffs, violating California Labor Code Section 224, which prohibits employers from making deductions from an employee's wages unless permitted by law or with the employee's explicit consent. Mr. Tarabato's compensation of $6,000 and his employment terms were undermined by such actions, constituting a significant breach of wage protections.

4. **Retaliation Protections under State and Federal Law**

   Mr. Tarabato's termination, occurring immediately on March 25, suggests retaliation for his complaints about workplace conditions, in violation of both state and federal anti-retaliation laws. Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), it is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee for engaging in protected activities. Similarly, federal law under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) prohibits retaliation against employees who report discrimination or participate in related investigations. Cross Country Mortgage LLC's actions appear to contravene these legal protections, further evidencing wrongful termination.

   - **Source**: EEOC - [Retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation)

These legal violations highlight the need for immediate corrective actions by Cross Country Mortgage LLC to address the grievances of Mr. Tarabato and to comply with applicable labor laws and safety regulations.

# Demands for Relief

Pursuant to the grievances and violations outlined above, Michael Tarabato hereby demands the following relief from Cross Country Mortgage LLC ("Cross Country"):

1. **Back Pay for Unauthorized Deductions or Withheld Wages:**
   Under California Labor Code Section 224, it is impermissible for an employer to deduct wages from an employee without explicit written consent or a lawful requirement. Mr. Tarabato seeks full restitution of any wages unlawfully deducted during his tenure as an appraiser, beginning January 2016, until the date of his termination on March 25. The amount sought shall reflect the full pay rate of $6,000 per month, adjusted for any unauthorized deductions. (California Labor Code § 224, https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2024/labor-code/division-2/part-1/chapter-1/article-1/section-224/)

2. **Compensation for Damages Related to Wrongful Termination and Unsafe Working Conditions:**
   As evidenced by the incident of immediate termination without cause, Mr. Tarabato has suffered wrongful termination, a violation supported by the precedent set in Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., which necessitates legitimate reasons for termination. Furthermore, the failure of Cross Country to maintain a safe working environment contravenes Cal/OSHA regulations, endangering Mr. Tarabato's health and safety during his employment. Thus, Mr. Tarabato demands compensation for all damages incurred, including lost wages, emotional distress, and any statutory penalties due under California employment law. (Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal.4th 1238 (1994), https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/4th/7/1238.html; Cal/OSHA, https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/)

3. **Immediate Improvements in Workplace Safety to Comply with OSHA Standards:**
   Cross Country is required to implement immediate changes to its workplace safety policies to comply with Cal/OSHA standards. This includes conducting a thorough review and rectification of all safety protocols at the California work location to prevent future occupational hazards and ensure compliance with California Code of Regulations, Title 8. Mr. Tarabato demands that Cross Country provide a detailed plan for these improvements within 30 days of receipt of this letter. (Cal/OSHA, https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/)

Failure to address these demands will compel Mr. Tarabato to pursue all available legal remedies to secure the relief he is rightfully entitled to under the law. The gravity of these violations necessitates prompt action to rectify the harm caused and prevent future transgressions.

# Establishing a Timeline

To substantiate the claims of wrongful termination and violation of employment rights, it is essential to present a chronological timeline of the relevant incidents, complaints, and responses that have transpired between Michael Tarabato, an appraiser at Cross Country Mortgage LLC, and the employer. This timeline serves to demonstrate a pattern of violations and provides clarity on the sequence of events leading to the current demand.

1. **January 2016** - Michael Tarabato commenced employment with Cross Country Mortgage LLC as an appraiser, stationed in California. From the outset, Mr. Tarabato satisfactorily fulfilled his duties under the agreed terms of employment, which included a pay rate of $6,000 per month and a standard 8-hour workday schedule.

2. **March 25, 2023** - On this date, Mr. Tarabato was summarily terminated from his position without any provided reasoning or prior notice. This action stands in direct contravention of protections against wrongful termination as stipulated under California Labor Code § 6311, which prohibits the dismissal of an employee for refusing to work under unsafe conditions ([California Labor Code § 6311 (2024)](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-lab/division-5/part-1/chapter-1/section-6311/)).

3. **Incident Description** - The abrupt termination was executed without cause, and there were no recorded complaints or disciplinary actions against Mr. Tarabato prior to this event. This lack of due process and failure to provide a legitimate reason for termination further supports a claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy, as established in the precedent case of Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal.3d 167 (1980) ([Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy - Advocate Magazine](https://www.advocatemagazine.com/article/2015-june/wrongful-termination-in-violation-of-public-policy)).

4. **Employer Response** - To date, there has been no formal response or explanation provided by Cross Country Mortgage LLC regarding the termination. The absence of communication from the employer underscores a disregard for procedural fairness and transparency.

This timeline illustrates not only the abrupt nature of the termination but also highlights the absence of any legitimate grounds or employer engagement in addressing the termination. The documented events are instrumental in establishing a pattern of employer misconduct, thereby reinforcing the claims presented in this letter. It is imperative that Cross Country Mortgage LLC address these violations and respond with the appropriate remedies to rectify the situation.

# Legal Precedents and Cases

In support of the claims set forth in this demand letter, several legal precedents and statutory provisions underscore the validity of Michael Tarabato's allegations against Cross Country Mortgage LLC. These precedents highlight established protections for employees faced with unsafe working conditions, unauthorized wage deductions, and wrongful termination.

1. **Unsafe Working Conditions**

Michael Tarabato was subjected to working conditions that violated established safety regulations, prompting his rightful refusal to continue such work. Under California Labor Code Section 6311, employees are protected from discharge or discrimination for refusing to perform work that violates safety standards. This statute empowers employees to decline unsafe work without fear of retaliation, a principle upheld in the case of Division of Labor Law Enforcement v. Sampson, 64 Cal.App.3d 893 (Cal. Ct. App. 1976). In this case, the court affirmed the protections afforded to employees under similar circumstances, reinforcing the legal basis for Mr. Tarabato's claims. 

   - Citation: Cal. Lab. Code § 6311 (West 2024); Division of Labor Law Enforcement v. Sampson, 64 Cal.App.3d 893 (Cal. Ct. App. 1976).

2. **Unauthorized Payment Cutoffs**

Cross Country Mortgage LLC's actions in unilaterally deducting wages from Mr. Tarabato's pay without his explicit consent contravenes California Labor Code Section 224. This provision strictly limits the conditions under which employers may withhold wages, safeguarding employee earnings against unauthorized deductions. The precedent set by this statute ensures that employees, including Mr. Tarabato, are entitled to full compensation absent a written agreement permitting such deductions.

   - Citation: Cal. Lab. Code § 224 (West 2024).

3. **Wrongful Termination and Retaliation**

The termination of Michael Tarabato in retaliation for his lawful and protected actions constitutes wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The landmark case of Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 610 P.2d 1330 (Cal. 1980), established the tort of wrongful termination when an employee is discharged for reasons that contravene fundamental public policy. Additionally, California Labor Code Section 1102.5 prohibits retaliation against employees for engaging in protected activities, such as reporting unsafe working conditions or challenging improper wage practices.

   - Citation: Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 610 P.2d 1330 (Cal. 1980); Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5 (West 2024).

These legal precedents and statutory protections substantiate the claims made by Michael Tarabato and provide a compelling basis for the demands outlined in this letter. The cited cases and statutes collectively affirm Mr. Tarabato's rights and highlight the legal obligations of Cross Country Mortgage LLC to rectify the violations he has endured.

# Closing Statements

In summary, this demand letter has outlined the serious legal violations committed by Cross Country Mortgage LLC against Mr. Michael Tarabato, which include unsafe working conditions, unauthorized pay deductions, and wrongful termination without cause. These actions are in direct violation of several key legal statutes, including California Labor Code Section 6311 and Section 224, along with federal OSHA regulations that mandate a safe working environment and protect against unauthorized deductions.

It is imperative to recognize the gravity of the infractions committed. As stated, the termination of Mr. Tarabato’s employment on March 25, without just cause and in the absence of any prior complaints or warnings, represents a clear breach of his rights as an employee under the aforementioned legal protections. The circumstances surrounding his termination suggest a retaliatory motive, which further compounds the seriousness of the situation.

We are prepared to engage in constructive dialogue to resolve this matter amicably. However, if Cross Country Mortgage LLC fails to respond appropriately and in a timely manner, we are fully prepared to pursue all available legal remedies to protect Mr. Tarabato’s rights and interests. This includes potentially initiating legal proceedings to seek compensation for damages and ensure compliance with applicable labor laws.

We trust that Cross Country Mortgage LLC will take these matters seriously and address them with the urgency and gravity they deserve. We look forward to your prompt response to this letter so as to avoid further escalation.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Michael Tarabato
